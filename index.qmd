## BOOST-EDS

-   Proof-of-concept cloud workflow
-   Demonstrate EDS services within BAS
-   JASMIN Object Store, Datalabs
-   Records barriers and feed into WP4

## Technical Overview

## Use-case 1: Amundsen Sea Low Index (ASLI)

-   Highly dynamic, mobile climatological low pressure system
-   Crucial in understanding regional change over West Antarctica
-   Good ASL representation improve climate models

## Use-case 1: User requirements

1.  Run monthly, when new ERA5 data is released
2.  Human in-the-loop to approve data transfer
3.  Automatic ingestion into the PDC, appending dataset
4.  ERA5 re-calculation detection, triggering new DOI
5.  Datalabs notebooks/application to interact with data

## Use-case 1: Summary
- Useful demonstration of EDS services
- Exposes limitations in current EDS offering
- Not a genomics dataset
- Quick implementation, project needs
- Focus is on feeding into WP4
