## BOOST-EDS

- Proof-of-concept cloud workflow
- Goals:
  1. Demonstrate NERC Environmental Data Service (EDS) tools and how we can leverage them at BAS
  2. Broader message on how to prepare research software for operationalisation.

## NERC EDS and its services
- What is the EDS?
- What is JASMIN?
- What is Datalabs?
- How do the data centres fit in? 

## Archival into the UK Polar Data centre
- NERC Data Policy
- Data Management Plan (DMP)
- Minting of DOI
- BODC, NGDC, CEDA, EIDC
- DSW, FAIR Principles

## Use-case 1: Amundsen Sea Low Index (ASLI)

-   Highly dynamic, mobile climatological low pressure system
-   Crucial in understanding regional change over West Antarctica
-   Good ASL representation improve climate models

## Use-case 1: ASLI Image

## Use-case 1: User Requirements

1. Run monthly, when new ERA5 data is released.
1. Automated data processing pipeline which performs calculations.
1. Data accessible to other systems, notebook, app, digital twin?
1. Automatic archival into the PDC, appending dataset under same DOI.

## Use-case 1: The Onion
* [asli](https://github.com/davidwilby/amundsen-sea-low-index) (Hosking & Wilby 2024): Python package containing ASL calculations described in Hosking et al. (2016).
* [asli-pipeline](https://github.com/antarctica/asli-pipeline): Data processing pipeline.
* [asliapp](https://github.com/antarctica/asliapp/tree/main): Shiny application.

## Use-case 1: Technical Implementation

## Discussion: FAIR Principles
- FAIR Principles: archival of "live" data products.
- Providing full provenance for a derived dataset.

## Discussion: Operationalising Research Software
- Combining digital research infrastructure (DRI).
- Separation of **data - code - configuration**.
- Enabling deployment on different DRI.
- Preparing RS for deployment to operational systems ahead of time

## Discussion: Limitations of EDS servicse
- Digital **research** infrastructure - not for production.
- _"Everything is prototype"._
- No clear guidance on cloud-optimised data formats keeping in mind accessibility to large datasets, performance, cost-effectiveness, reliability, collaboration benefits
